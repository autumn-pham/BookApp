A Novel Idea is an book that allows a user to review staff recomendation books, build and maintain their own book list and search Google Books API for a book by title. It has four models, one for the book data and one for each of the staff favorites list.

Technical details:
The app we created uses the following technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Heroku, Node.js, Mongo DB, API and multiple models.

Styling:
For the styling we used flex and materialize to get the card reveals for the books, the buttons, the navigation bar and the contact chips.  We used Google Fonts for the font and Font Awesome for the Social Media Icons.

Technical challenges:
-Unable to expand the boook card reveal.
-Unable to successfully pre-populate the edit fields and update them with the defaultValue.

Unsolved problems:
-none

What went well for our group:
-no git issues
-using trello to stay on top of tasks

What was our groups biggest struggle:
-working on code one at a time to avoid git issues

What was the most useful tool we relied on the most:
- using git feature branches to keep our changes separate 

What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didn't anticipate:
-not being able to all work at the same time

Improvements we would like to make:
-Add Log-in/sign-up logic
-Find a way to pre-populate fields and use that information to update the API if it was not edited
-Animation for buttons or social icons
-Force created and edit summaries to close after button clicked instead of having to scroll up and click the 'X' button

User Stories:
-As a friend/admirer of staff picks, I would like to see staff book recommendations so I could read them as well
-As a reading enthusiast, I would like to create a list of books I could add to, update and delete
-As a reading enthusiest, I would like to be able to retrieve useful information about a book by searching with a book title

Stretch goals:
-multiple models
-used materialize CSS Framework
-used figma to generate wire frame
